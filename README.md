getting started tutorial repository
I'm Jeffery Decker, and I'm taking some programming classes.
I'm also working on some development projects relating to literacy, mental health, affect interpretation and other human interface issues.
I'm doing this tutorial as part of my Data Structures in Java class with Instructor Michelle Ruse at the Des Moines Area Community College.
